small/realistic ideas for this project
c prog: works like man but short.  ref grep prints all of the options that i find useful in grep.  ref 3 printf shows all the printf escape codes and shit.  make up new nwumbers for sections (like scripting lnaguages, apis, etc)
c prog: mkalias - an autosaving alias
command that allows you tu turn a command into a c api by analyizing arguments
c prog; notes
c prog: install pacman from file (unless bar operator permits it)
c prog: makezprog: creates a zsh z function template
find a way to integrate these c functions in zsh:w:Lw

Long term/unlikely
AI that trains from existing man pages and generates new ones
AI that reads source code and generates man pages
