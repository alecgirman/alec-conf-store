C Programs/Modules:
	works like man but short.  ref grep prints all of the options that i find useful in grep.  ref 3 printf shows all the printf escape codes and shit.  make up new nwumbers for sections (like scripting lnaguages, apis, etc)
	mkalias - an autosaving alias
	notes
	install pacman from file (unless bar operator permits it)
	makezprog: creates a zsh z function template
	turns a command into a c api by analyizing arguments
	call library functions as a command

Modules
	notes - quickly compose and organize private notes in the command line

Long term/unlikely (cool ideas though)
	AI that trains from existing man pages and generates new ones
	AI that reads source code and generates man pages
