----

Configs:

### Nvim config sync finally complete!

[x] Get nvim config setup
    [x] personal config
    [x] third party plugins

[ ] Customize ZSH
    [ ] create and source custom zshrc file
[/] Customize nvim per-language macros, scripts, and snippets
[x] Add ui config files
[ ] UI Extras pkgs 

Misc:

[ ] **Make boot script clone and backup the ashe directory on boot**
[ ] **shutdown script using zsh alias that will auto-push to /dev/pulse**

**Due to data loss due to system freezes, a backup solution is VERY necessary for 2.0**

[x] backup x window config, I have chrome shortcut in /fdp/user/Desktop

~~Long term ideas~~ DevOps Necessities for this project, **this needs to happen in 2.0**

[ ] **Unit tests**

[ ] **Docker**

Long term goals/ideas:

[ ] Make ashe a custom shell written in C/C++

[x] Maybe add some sort of vim keybind functionality to make it great for power users
