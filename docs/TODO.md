Key

[ ] = Not done

[x] = Done

[/] = In progress or partially done
----

Organization:

[ ] folder restructuring
	* make a projects folder, everything i make goes there
	* organize by name or language
	* release binaries must still symilnk to ashe/bin

Configs:

### Nvim config sync finally complete!

[x] Get nvim config setup
    [x] personal config
    [x] third party plugins

[ ] Customize ZSH
    [ ] create and source custom zshrc file
[/] Customize nvim per-language macros, scripts, and snippets
[x] Add ui config files
[ ] UI Extras pkgs 

Misc:

[ ] **Make boot script clone and backup the ashe directory on boot**
[ ] **shutdown script using zsh alias that will auto-push to /dev/pulse**
[ ] Change elinks settings on synced config: 
	[x] document.browsing - meta minimum set to 500 or lower
	[x] document.browsing.access keys - set top two options to 1
	[x] document.browsing.forms - set confirm submission to 1
	[x] document.browsing.links.active - enable number keys
	[x] document.browsing.searching - enable regex
	[x] ui - show ip, always show menu, display goto in new tab
	[ ] customize colors!

**Due to data loss due to system freezes, a backup solution is VERY necessary for 2.0**

[x] backup x window config, I have chrome shortcut in /fdp/user/Desktop

~~Long term ideas~~ DevOps Necessities for this project, **this needs to happen in 2.0**

[ ] **Unit tests**

[ ] **Docker**

Long term goals/ideas:

[ ] Make ashe a custom shell written in C/C++

[x] Maybe add some sort of vim keybind functionality to make it great for power users
	* neosnippet and deoplete took over the game here :)
