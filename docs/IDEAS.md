C Programs/Modules:

	* [\*] ref - a personal tldr for manpages - Still an absolute must have.  I should include other sources such as Qt and pydoc.

	* [?] mkalias - an autosaving alias **may not be necessary after 2.0**

	* [\*] notes - command to quickly take notes and organize them in sections

	* [?] makemodule - automatically and interactively create modules (in c)

	* ~~install pacman from file (unless bar operator permits it)~~
		* This was completed awhile ago, pacman will first check your local cache when installing, so I saved downloads onto a persistent drive
		and symlink the directory at boot.
	 
	* [**2.0**] call library functions as a command - After playing around with
	shared libraries in python and how easy it is to communitcate between languages,
	I've determined this feature is likely to come sometime within version 2.

Vim Plugins

    * plugin to draw boxes, lines, and simple shapes

    * Building off of boxes, a spreadsheet program would be lit

Long term/unlikely (cool ideas though)

	* AI that trains from existing man pages and generates new ones

	* AI that reads source code and generates man pages
