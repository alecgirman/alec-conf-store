C Programs/Modules:

	* ref - a personal tldr for manpages

	* mkalias - an autosaving alias

	* notes - command to quickly take notes and organize them in sections

	* makemodule - automatically and interactively create modules (in c)

	* install pacman from file (unless bar operator permits it)
	 
	* turns a command into a c api by analyizing arguments

	* call library functions as a command

Vim Plugins

	* commit preview - when the commit message file is open, have a side panel showing the files changed and preview them when selected

		* I'd prefer to make my own

		* definitely will try out tpope/fugitive

    * plugin to draw boxes, lines, and simple shapes

    * Building off of boxes, a spreadsheet program would be lit

Modules

	* notes - quickly compose and organize private notes in the command line


Long term/unlikely (cool ideas though)

	* AI that trains from existing man pages and generates new ones

	* AI that reads source code and generates man pages
