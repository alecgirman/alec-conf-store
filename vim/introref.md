Thanks for downloading my config and plugin pack (well none
of the plugins are made by me but i picked out all the useful ones
(so i removed the ones that wouldnt be of any use to you.)

To turn off the automatic loading of plugins, simply delete
the `init.vim` file in the config directory, which should be
(its a long directory but ill show you a shortcut) in this folder:
/root/.vim/pack/config/start/config/init.vim

Tip: if you put your cursor anywhere in the filepath and type
'gf', it will go straight to that file!  this includes #includes
in C/C++, imports in python, and probably a few more.

Want to see what was added, you can get a summery by checking out
the commands added by the plugin by typing colon then hitting
tab to open up autocomplete.  Holding tab scrolls through the
list.  To get a full overview of the new plugins, use the following
help comand: 
                :help local-additions

AHEM AHEM

You can find very helpful reference pages using some commands.
