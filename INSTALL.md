Currently, due to the rapid development, there is no stable go-to build, however, my focus will shift towards making a docker container that everyone can use.

*Alternatively*, you may install an older version from any previous commit to the master branch.

**ZSH:**

As of January 5th, I now have my full zsh configuration in this repo!
As I work to migrate all of my configs into Github, this is the first major one to adapt a new
integration method that will have the git repo always up to date.  The zsh configuration can
be installed with the following:
```zsh
git clone https://github.com/alecgirman/ashe.git
cd ashe
make install
```
