Currently, due to the rapid development, there is no stable go-to build, however, my focus will shift towards making a docker container that everyone can use.

*Alternatively*, you may install an older version from any previous commit to the master branch.

**ZSH:**

As of January 5th, I now have my full zsh configuration in this repo!
As I work to migrate all of my configs into Github, this is the first major one to adapt a new
integration method that will have the git repo always up to date.  The zsh configuration can
be installed with the following:
```zsh
git clone https://github.com/alecgirman/ashe.git
cd ashe
make install
```
**Termite**

The same instructions above apply for termite too, but depending on which device you are on, you should
select the install method explicitly.  The desktop config uses size 14 font and surface uses size 24.
The surface config was built for running on the Microsoft Surface Book 2 with Arch Linux and is very
large due to its lack of DPI scaling.
