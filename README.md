~Alec's SHell Extensions (ASHE)~

~Dotfile and config store used to keep multiple linux installations and instances in sync.~

~I probably won't be taking many contributions as this is my personal linux config, however feel free to fork it, change it, and use it on your own!  Please note that if you choose to fork this and use it on your own, it is strongly reccomended to manually modify a few files due to the fact they are hard-coded to detect y computers.  The following files are currently made this way:~

~*nvim/arch_init/boot.sh*~

~**Please see INSTALL.md for more information regarding the usage and installation of these scripts.**~

# This readme is out of date.  Please wait until this message is gone before attempting to try it out.  Large changes are being made and stability is not guaranteed.

I forgot to update the readme and install instructions with the changes made in dev (dev/pulse).  This should be fixed today (10/20)
