# Alec's SHell Extensions (ASHE)

This is my personal dotfile repo.

## NEW: One tap install for all config files!

Currently, most config directories now have install scripts in them that will automatically install
my configuration.  Since this list will be growing rapidly, there is one central install script that
installs all compatible files in just one command.  This setup is also made so that I can always have
the latest up-to-date config in one place and not have to deal with different versions of the same
file in many places.

**See INSTALL.md for more info!**
