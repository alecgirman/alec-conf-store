Alec's SHell Extensions (ASHE)

Dotfile and config store used to keep multiple linux installations and instances in sync.

I probably won't be taking many contributions as this is my personal linux config, however feel free to fork it, change it, and use it on your own!  Please note that if you choose to fork this and use it on your own, it is strongly reccomended to manually modify a few files due to the fact they are hard-coded to detect y computers.  The following files are currently made this way:

*nvim/arch_init/boot.sh
