Alec's SHell Extensions (ASHE)

Dotfile and config store used to keep multiple linux installations and instances in sync

I probably won't be taking many contributions as this is my personal linux config, however feel free to fork it, change it, and use it on your own!  Please note that if you choose to fork this and use it on your own, it is strongly reccomended to manually modify a few files due to the fact they are hard-coded to detect y computers.  The following files are currently made this way:

**The boot scripts located in ashe/zsh/boot/ contain some logic that is hardcoded to perform specific actions depending on which computer of mine it is running on.  The consequence of running it without modification should not be dangerous, however, it will likely misconfigure some settings and may
not install necessary components to properly run on your PC.  Please take the time to modify thse files if you wish to use this configuration.**

**Please see docs/INSTALL.md for more information regarding the usage and installation of these scripts.**
