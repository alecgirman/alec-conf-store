# Alec's SHell Extensions (ASHE)

`~This project is my essentially my ultra-portable Arch Linux config.  It contains all config files needed to go from Live USB boot straight to a beautiful KDE-powered desktop.~`

As my day to day workflow is turning entirely linux-only, I have linux installed locally on my machine, so I do not have a script one may use to boot right into.

**However**, the plan to containerize and distribute my setup has not gone away.  I will begin to focus on containers and docker soon and I plan to have a working dockerfile
replica of my various applications, development setups, and core OS config for everyone to use.

I probably won't be taking many contributions as this is my personal linux config, however feel free to fork it, change it, and use it on your own!  Or even bette>, if the>>re 
is a better way to do something or ways ot improve my code (its the farthest ting from perfect so this shouldn't be hard at all).
