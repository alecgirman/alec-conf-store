# Alec's SHell Extensions (ASHE)

**This project is my essentially my ultra-portable Arch Linux config.  It contains 
all config files needed to go from Live USB boot straight to a beautiful KDE-powered desktop.**

I probably won't be taking many contributions as this is my personal linux config, however feel free to fork it, change it, and use it on your own!  Please note that if you choose to fork this and use it on your own, it is strongly reccomended to manually modify a few files due to the fact they are hard-coded to detect y computers.  The following files are currently made this way:

### The switch to Python

Currently as an effort to version 2.0, I'm converting all of the ZSH scripts to python scripts.  For whatever reason,
I can easily pick up on any language except for shell scripts like bash and zsh.   As an effort to a) speed up development,
and b) make the scripts easier to read and work with overall, I concluded that the transition to python would be the best.

*I'm aiming to complete most of this during this weekend, but we'll see*
