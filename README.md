# NOOP REPOSITORY

**WARNING: This is the noop (non-operational) repository.  That means the changes made here are guranteed NOT to work and are likely there as a remote stash or just to**
**sync to another device.  Just like every branch, I'm not going to tell you that you can't clone it but it would be a stupid idea.**
