# Alec's SHell Extensions (ASHE)

**This project is my essentially my ultra-portable Arch Linux config.  It contains 
all config files needed to go from Live USB boot straight to a beautiful KDE-powered desktop.**

I probably won't be taking many contributions as this is my personal linux config, however feel free to fork it, change it, and use it on your own!  Please note that if you choose to fork this and use it on your own, it is strongly reccomended to manually modify a few files due to the fact they are hard-coded to detect y computers.  The following files are currently made this way:

Over the last week, I fixed a few major bugs, which I decided to start documenting.  IF
I wasn't fixing bugs, I was updating my nvim keybindings to make my config more
personalized.  In this stable push, neovim works great but there is no full install
script.  INSTALL.md has more info on installing this.
