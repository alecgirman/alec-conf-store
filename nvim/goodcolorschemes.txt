any wombat colorscheme

neon

: extremely vibrant colors on a black background, what can go wrong
vividchalk - tgc (with simple airline theme)

Not too bad:
elflord - notgc
midnight - notgc
tango - notgc
xoria256 - nice blend all together but not as vibrant text



For wombat ones, must do all color changes on the first window or else every window will be different.
